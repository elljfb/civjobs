Civil Service Behaviours are the actions and activities that lead to effective performance in UK government roles. They form one part of the Civil Service's "Success Profiles" framework, used in recruitment to find the right person for the job by assessing a blend of Behaviours, Strengths, Experience, Ability, and Technical skills. For candidates, understanding these behaviours is crucial to successfully navigating the application and interview process.

This guide will help you understand what these behaviours are and how you can effectively demonstrate them to secure a Civil Service role.

## What are Civil Service Behaviours?

The Civil Service Behaviours are a set of nine core standards that define how civil servants should perform their duties. They are designed to be observable and measurable, helping recruiting managers predict your future performance in the role.

It is important to note that you will not be asked to demonstrate all nine behaviours for a single role. The hiring manager will select a few that are most relevant to the position. The specific behaviours being assessed will be clearly listed in the job description, so always read it carefully.

## The Success Profiles Framework

Behaviours are just one element of the wider Success Profiles system. The five elements are:

- **Behaviours**: How you act and deliver results.
- **Strengths**: What you naturally do well and are motivated by.
- **Experience**: The knowledge and mastery you've gained from past activities.
- **Ability**: Your aptitude or potential to perform to the required standard.
- **Technical**: Specific professional skills, knowledge, or qualifications.

This framework allows for a more flexible and holistic assessment of candidates, moving beyond a rigid, competency-only approach.

## The 9 Civil Service Behaviours

The following table outlines the nine core behaviours and what they mean in practice.

| Behaviour | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| **Seeing the Big Picture** | Understand how your role fits with and supports organisational objectives. Recognise the wider Civil Service priorities and ensure work is in the national interest. |
| **Changing and Improving** | Seek out opportunities to create effective change and suggest innovative ideas for improvement. Review ways of working, including seeking and providing feedback. |
| **Making Effective Decisions** | Use evidence and knowledge to support accurate, expert decisions and advice. Carefully consider alternative options, implications and risks of decisions. |
| **Leadership** | Show pride and passion for public service. Create and engage others in delivering a shared vision. Value difference, diversity and inclusion, ensuring fairness and opportunity for all. |
| **Communicating and Influencing** | Communicate purpose and direction with clarity, integrity and enthusiasm. Respect the needs, responses and opinions of others. |
| **Working Together** | Form effective partnerships and relationships with people both internally and externally, from a range of diverse backgrounds, sharing information, resources and support. |
| **Developing Self and Others** | Focus on continuous learning and development for self, others and the organisation as a whole. |
| **Managing a Quality Service** | Deliver service objectives with professional excellence, expertise and efficiency, taking account of diverse customer needs. |
| **Delivering at Pace** | Take responsibility for delivering timely and quality results with focus and drive. |

## Behaviours are Grade-Specific

The expectations for demonstrating these behaviours vary depending on the seniority of the role. What is expected of an Administrative Officer (AO) is different from what is expected of an Executive Officer (EO) or a Senior Civil Servant. The job description and the official Success Profiles guidance on [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk) provide detailed examples for each grade level.

## How to Demonstrate Civil Service Behaviours

Your behaviours can be assessed at various stages of the recruitment process through several methods:

- **Application Form**: Requiring written examples.
- **CV/Personal Statement**: Where you can highlight behaviours.
- **Interview**: The most common place for behaviour-based questions.
- **Assessment Centre**: Including exercises like presentations, in-tray exercises, role-plays, and group discussions.

### Using the STAR Method

When you are asked to provide an example of a time you demonstrated a behaviour (in your application or at an interview), the most effective technique is the STAR method. This structure ensures your answer is clear, concise, and evidence-based.

- **S - Situation**: Briefly describe the context. What was the project, task, or challenge? 
  - *Example*: "In my previous role, our team was tasked with launching a new public awareness campaign with a very tight deadline."

- **T - Task**: What was your specific responsibility or goal in that situation? 
  - *Example*: "My task was to lead the digital marketing element of the campaign and ensure it reached our target audience."

- **A - Action**: This is the most critical part. What specific steps did you take? Use "I" statements. 
  - *Example*: "I developed a detailed content calendar, I coordinated with the design team to create assets, and I analysed social media insights to refine our approach."

- **R - Result**: What was the outcome? Quantify it if possible. What did you learn? 
  - *Example*: "As a result, we saw a 25% increase in online engagement and successfully reached our campaign targets. I also learned the importance of agile planning when working to a tight deadline."

### Where to Find Your Examples

You do not need all your examples to come from paid work. Recruiters welcome examples from:

- Work experience
- Volunteering
- Hobbies or personal projects

## Preparing for Behaviour-Based Interview Questions

In an interview, you will likely be asked questions that begin with, "Tell me about a time when you..." These are designed to probe the specific behaviours required for the job.

Here are some sample questions aligned to the behaviours:

- **Seeing the Big Picture**: "Describe a time when you had to consider the wider implications of your work beyond your immediate team."
- **Changing and Improving**: "Tell me about a time you suggested a change that improved a process or service."
- **Making Effective Decisions**: "Give an example of a decision you made using data or evidence."
- **Leadership**: "Describe a time you took the lead on a project or task, even if you weren't the formal manager."
- **Communicating and Influencing**: "Provide an example of how you successfully communicated complex information to a diverse group of stakeholders."

## A Note on Strengths

In your interview, you may also be asked strengths-based questions. These are different from behaviour questions. They are designed to find out what you naturally enjoy and are good at, with the idea that you will perform better in a role that aligns with your innate strengths.

Questions are often more direct, such as "What do you enjoy about analysing data?" or "Do you prefer working in a team or on your own?" The key here is to be authentic and show enthusiasm. There are no right or wrong answers, but there are answers that are a better fit for the role. The official advice is not to rehearse these answers, as interviewers are looking for your initial, genuine response.

## Final Tips for Success

- **Read the Job Description Meticulously**: It is your blueprint, telling you exactly which behaviours and strengths will be assessed.
- **Prepare Multiple Examples**: Have 2-3 strong STAR examples prepared for each of the behaviours listed in the job description. This gives you flexibility.
- **Practice Out Loud**: Rehearse your examples until they sound natural and confident, not robotic.
- **Be Specific and Personal**: Focus on what you did. Use "I" statements in the "Action" part of your STAR examples, not "we."
- **Know the Civil Service Code**: Familiarise yourself with the core values of integrity, honesty, objectivity, and impartiality that underpin all civil service work.

By thoroughly understanding the Civil Service Behaviours and preparing thoughtful, evidence-based examples, you will be well-equipped to demonstrate your suitability and succeed in your civil service application.

Good luck!
